Second singular Values

The second singular values of the matrix are able to show what letters are most commonly preceded by a vowel or a consonant. To identify a vowel the orognal matrix is looked at and the average frequency for how often a letter occurs before or after another letter is found. The vowels are the letters that surpass the average frequency per letter for the most letters. For example if the average frequency for a letter to occur before B is 61 then the frequency for A to occur before B (628) is significantly higher. A has a higher frequency than the average for being in front of a letter for 18 letters, significantly more than half. A similiar pattern can be seen for all vowels. After using this method to identify what is considered a vowel and a consonant the second singular value is able to sort what type of letter a letter is preceded and followed by.
